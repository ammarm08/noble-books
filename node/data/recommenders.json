Disruptive technologies are often born on the fringes, in markets where worse is better.\"","\"Kuhn introduced the term 'paradigm shift' to describe the changeover from Ptolemaic to Copernican astronomy. But the book is far more than a classic in the history of science. It's also a book that emphasizes how what we already believe shapes what we see, what we allow ourselves to think.\"","\"I discovered this series of six difficult, complex historical novels about a character roving the world at the turn of the seventeenth century as my company was passing the critical 50-person inflection point. Lymond is a brilliant leader who isn't afraid of the opprobrium of his peers--he does the right thing, seeing further than those around him. He was a hero I aspired to emulate. \"","\"Anyone who wants to start a business with impact needs to read [this].\"","\"The idea here is that great companies aren't afraid to have strong values. In fact, their cult-like values are what make them stand out from the norm.\"","\"This book gave me a whole new set of tools for thinking about the complex interplay between four forces: government laws and regulations, social norms, technology, and markets. Lessig makes a simple but profound case that you can't think of technical issues in isolation from their legal and cultural context.\"","\"The core message of all Herbert's work is that we can't control the future, but we can control our response to it, surfing the edge of change and risk.\"","\"Johnson's work is a wonderful reminder that our minds have prodigious energy that must be focused on the right objects, and that much human pathology comes from having insufficient objects for our striving.\"","\"This book introduced me to the profundity of Aristotle. Virtue is the control of the appetites by right reason, the formation of good habits, or as my brother James once summarized it, 'Virtue is knowing what you really want.'\"","\"A utopian novel written in the 1930s, about an imaginary country where technology has not yet hastened the pace of life, and where people find time to nurture relationships and the land they live on.\"","\"John Cowper Powys makes the point that the difference between education and culture is that culture is the incorporation of music, art, literature, and philosophy not just into your library or your CV but into who you are. He talks too about the interplay of culture and life, the way that what we read can enrich what we experience, and what we experience can enrich what we read.\"","\"Stevens is my favorite poet, and this is the most commonly available collection of his poems. His meditations on the relationship of language and reality have entranced me for more than thirty years. I keep reading the same poems, and finding more and more in them.\"","\"OK, General Semantics was the 30s equivalent of pop-psychology in the 70s, but there are some great concepts there. 'The map is not the territory.' The idea is that people get stuck in concepts and don't go back to observation.\"","\"In addition to its articulation of the Unix tools philosophy that is so dear to my heart, the writing is a model of clarity and elegance. As a technical writer, I aspired to be as transparent as Kernighan.\"","\"I wouldn't say this book influenced me, since my principles of writing were established long before I read it.

It vindicates those of us who hold that financial modeling is neither practical nor scientific. Exceedingly readable.\"","\"The book is a great exposition of modern scientific thinking and understanding of the nature of man–but it spends some time on topics that are entirely obvious outside of the humanities academia. Indeed Pinker gives them too much respect by honoring them with such a lengthy reply.\"","\"Humphrey is the only person I know of who can work on nonhuman primates, write philosophy, and edit a literary magazine.\"","\"This book is a great attempt at finding some universality based on systems in a 'critical' state, with departures from such state taking place in a manner that follows power laws. The sandpile is a great baby model for that.\"","\"I read here and there comments by neuroscientists dissing the book over small details perhaps invisible even to experts. I just realize that Carter should keep updating it, as it is invaluable in my suitcase when I travel! I do not conceal my suspicion of 'science writers' and journalists more trained in communicating than understanding and usually shallow babblers but Carter is an exception.\"","\"Clearly this is not for scholars as it is extremely diluted and slow at times; this is a popular science book. Still, I could not put it down.\"","\"I am buying another copy of this book as mine was lost or misplaced. That should speak volumes.\"","\"This is a gem for a singular reason. One sees exactly how Villani (or a pure mathematician) goes from abstract to abstract without ever exiting the world of pure and symbolic mathematics, even though the subject concerns a very concrete real-world topic.\"","\"Maggie Mahar had the courage to take a look at what was behind all of this religious belief in markets.\"","\"When history is written, this will be used, not the spin by the bankers’ slaves and soldiers (Geithner, Rubin et al.) Bravo Sheila!\"","\"I am glad to find a complete book dealing with all aspects of consciousness in CLEARLY written format, with graphs and tables to facilitate comprehension. The book covers everything I had seen before from Artificial Intelligence to Philosophy to Neurology to Evolutionary Biology.\"","\"I initially bought this book as I was curious about the differences between Eastern & Western traditions, particularly with the notion of theosis –the deification of man. This book goes far deeper, and covers pre-Christian practices (like Stoic thoughts, the deifications of Kings, Roman Emperors, that of private citizens who committed symbolic acts –such as Antinous, Hadrian’s obsession, who drowned to 'save' mankind and other sotirologies).\"","\"I read this book twice. The first time, I thought that it was excellent, the best compendium of ideas of social science by arguably the best thinker in the field. I took copious notes, etc. I agreed with its patchwork-style approach to rational decision making. I knew that it had huge insights applicable to my refusal of general theories [they don’t work], rather limit ourselves to nuts and bolts [they work].\"","\"It is a MUST read. Please go buy it. Read it twice, not once. Although the author does not take my drastic stochastic tinkering approach, he provides all kind of empirical evidence for the role of design. He does not directly discuss the narrative fallacy(q.v.) and the retrospective distortion (q.v.) but he certainly allows us to rewrite the history of medicine.\"","\"If you want an introduction to information theory, and, in a way, probability theory from the real front door, this is it. A clearly written book, very intuitive, explains things, such as the Monty Hall problem in a few lines.\"","\"Aside from the purely philosophical answers that scientists were grappling with, the book is like a manual for a new regimen in philosophy. It reviews everything from epistemology to the logic of contingency, with insights here and there about such topics as the observer biases (about computing probabilities when our existence has been linked to a particular realization of the process).\"","\"The mathematics of extreme events, or the remote parts of the probability distributions, is a discipline on its own, more important than any other with respect to risk and decisions since some domains are dominated by the extremes: for the class of subexponential (and of course for the subclass of power laws) the tails ARE the story. Now this book is the bible for the field.\"","\"Robert Shiller has the remarkable ability to think independently and the courage to propose ideas that to middlebrow thinkers may sound speculative.\"","\"The style is lapidary with remarkable precision; it has texture, wealth of details, and creates a mesmerizing athmosphere. Once you enter it, you are stuck there.\"","\"I know which books I value when I end up buying a second copy after losing the first one. This book gives a complete overview of the basis of probability theory with some grounding in measure theory, and presents the main proofs.\"","\"Masterly! This is the page turner par excellence; every new page brings some surprise and it was impossible for me to put the book down. I even read some of it during elevator rides, not being able to resist. And truly sophisticated: Nobody but Peter Tanous would have imagined to cross James Bond with a Catholic priest.\"","\"A wonderful book on wisdom and decision-making written by a wise decision-maker. This is the kind of book you read first, then leave by your bedside and re-read a bit every day, so you can slowly soak up the wisdom. \"","\"I spent some time looking for a simple bedside aggregation of the various topics associated with the psychology of decision making and the various perceptual biases, without finding much. [...] I was lucky to have found this book, which provides a wonderful and comprehensive coverage of the topics.\"","\"Very useful book, particularly in what concerns alternative L-Stable distributions. True, not too versed in financial theory but I’d rather see the author erring on the side of more physics than mathematical economics.\"","\"The book that carried the most influence on my thinking this year (I went back to it half a dozen times). This is a clearly written presentation of our inability to forecast our own behavior and to predict our emotional reactions to positive and negative events.\"","\"What struck me with this book is that Gray converges in opinion to the discoveries of the New Science of Man –without quoting from neurobiology, cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, the Kahneman-Tversky Heuristics & Biases Tradition.\"","\"This book in the Latin alphabet makes both Swadaya and Turoyo alive and easy to read, with all manner of real-world expressions. One can use it to supplement scholarly studies, or just to figure out how modern people speak our ancient language.\"","\"I owe a lot to this book. I figured out the value of intensity training and maximizing recovery. I use the ideas but with minor modifications (my own personal workout is entirely based on free weights and barbells, but I incur –and accept –a risk of injury). I have been applying the ideas for more than three years. Just get over the inhibitions (and illusions of control) and accept the idea of training less.\"","\"This is not a popularization /adult-education style presentation. Magee sees things form the inside; it is his own formation of philosophical ideas & techniques that we witness.\"","\"After spending some time working the derivations on scalable laws, extreme value theory, renormalization groups in this book, I elected to use it as my textbook. There is no equivalent. I have a dozen such yellow manuals; this one is complete and ultimately clearest.\"","\"I could not put it down. It hit me at some point that I was at the intersection of readability and scholarship. Clearly the value of this book lies beyond its readability: Gottlieb is both a philosopher and a journalist (in the good sense), not a journalist who writes about philosophy. \"","\"No financial book has the clarity of this text.\"","\"A charming primer on the paleo idea, with an illustration through the authors own life. I read it in one sitting.\"","\"Gary Taubes is a true empiricist. I can’t believe people hold on to the Platonicity of the thermodynamic theory of diet (calorie in = calorie out).\"","\"The man is one of the greatest traders in history. There are a few jewels in there.\"","\"This critique of the computational theory of mind and the pan-adaptionist tradition is clearly so honest that it goes after the ideas promoted by Fodor’s own 1983 watershed book The Modularity of Mind.\"","\"You are a hot shot in a company, though not the boss. You are paid extremely well, but, again you have plenty of bosses above you (say the partners of an investment firm). Is it better than deriving a modest income being your own boss? The counterintuive answer is NO. You will live longer in the second situation, even controlling for diet, lifestyle, and genetic predispositions.  Marmot spent years poring over data; he left no stone unturned and is well read in the general literature on human nature. This idea of people living longer when they exert control over their lives has not spread yet.\"","\"This is the most profound examination of how nationality is enforced on a group of people, with the internal colonization process and the stamping out of idiosyncratic traits.\"","\"This is a great synthesis of the modularity approach to cognitive science. It covers the entire field and has the right footnotes for the patches.\"","\"Colin McGINN teaches us that we need nevertheless to master the art of clarity of both thought and exposition. He write with perfect clarity: a clear, unburdened, unaffected, UnFrench UnGerman philosophical prose.\"","\"Great book. I ignored the connection to financial markets while reading it. But I learned that when under stress, one should seek the familiar. Bravo!\"","\"The point that top-down development methods are great on paper but have not produced benefits ('so far') is a point Easterly has made before, heavily influencing yours truly in the formation his own argument against naive interventionism.\"","\"The best intuition builder in both statistics and econometrics. I have been reading the various editions throught my career. Please, keep updating it, Peter Kennedy!\"","\"This is a great book for a refresher in analytical philosophy: pleasant, clear. Great training for people who tend to forget elementary relationships.\"","\"Excellent, be it only for the presentation of the difference between the pompous scholastic thinker laboring in the academy and the other nonacademic humanist laboring in the the 'luxe calme et volupte' of his study.\"","\"When I started reading the book I was taken aback by the combination of depth and the vividness of the style. Eco is sprightly and alive, something that cannot be said of many philosophers dealing with the subject of categories.\"","\"Buy 2 copies, just in case you lose one. This book has more meat than any other book in decision theory, economics, finance, etc…\"","\"There is something admirable about the school of the Russians: they are thinkers doing math, with remarkable clarity, minimal formalism, and total absence of unnecessary pedantry one finds in more modern texts (in the post Bourbaki era).\"","\"The book is so readable as to perhaps set a standard. Yet it is complete in the sense that it covers more of the evolutionary thinking than meets the eye. I didn’t realize it until I went to the site www.meangenes.org and got into the more technical research material. Reread it.\"","\"Mandelbrot brought fractals into mathematics by going to the general public. He is doing the same here: pleading to the regular man unburdened with knowledge of economics.\"","\"When readers and students ask to me for a useable book for nonmathematicians to get into probability (or a probabilistic approach to statistics), before embarking into deeper problems, I suggest this book by the Late A. Papoulis.\"","\"This book stands above, way above the rest: I’ve never seen a deeper exposition of the subject, as this text covers, in addition to the mathematical bases, the true philosophical origin of the notion of probability.\"","\"This book is outstanding in the following two aspects: 1) It is of immense clarity, embedding everything in real situations, 2) It uses the real-life situation to critique the statistical model and show you the limit of statistic.\"","\"This book is about Applied Ethics, a subject about which the author seems to know a bit. It also makes you feel like leading a quite thinking life in Edinburgh.  I don’t want to spoil the story but I felt that I was reading a detective story until I realized what it was…\"","\"I never understood why the book never made it in the Anglo-Saxon world. Il deserto is one of the 20th century’s masterpieces.\"","\"[Goldberg's] theory is that the hemispheric specialization is principally along pattern matching and information processing lines:the left side stores patterns, while the right one processes novel tasks.
