The book covers everything I had seen before from Artificial Intelligence to Philosophy to Neurology to Evolutionary Biology.\"","\"I initially bought this book as I was curious about the differences between Eastern & Western traditions, particularly with the notion of theosis –the deification of man. This book goes far deeper, and covers pre-Christian practices (like Stoic thoughts, the deifications of Kings, Roman Emperors, that of private citizens who committed symbolic acts –such as Antinous, Hadrian’s obsession, who drowned to 'save' mankind and other sotirologies).\"","\"I read this book twice. The first time, I thought that it was excellent, the best compendium of ideas of social science by arguably the best thinker in the field.

Read it twice, not once. Although the author does not take my drastic stochastic tinkering approach, he provides all kind of empirical evidence for the role of design. He does not directly discuss the narrative fallacy(q.v.) and the retrospective distortion (q.v.) but he certainly allows us to rewrite the history of medicine.\"","\"If you want an introduction to information theory, and, in a way, probability theory from the real front door, this is it.

You are paid extremely well, but, again you have plenty of bosses above you (say the partners of an investment firm). Is it better than deriving a modest income being your own boss? The counterintuive answer is NO. You will live longer in the second situation, even controlling for diet, lifestyle, and genetic predispositions.  Marmot spent years poring over data; he left no stone unturned and is well read in the general literature on human nature.
